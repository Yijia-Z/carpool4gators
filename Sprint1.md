# What issues your team planned to address

The front-end team plans to set up a homepage without a database for now, trying to design some elements and templates for pages on figma. Also, the react app should have the ability to call external API.

The back-end team

# Which ones were successfully completed

The front-end team successfully designed and refined the form of the web application, built a react app template and tried to call external API such as Mapbox (not yet used in actual web pages).

The back-end team

# Which ones didn't and why?

The front-end team did not organically combine all the elements needed in a web page because our team lacked experience with React, Node, and had weak CSS design skills. In addition, due to the inconsistency of the technology stack, the team spent a lot of time to work together and determine the final technology direction.
